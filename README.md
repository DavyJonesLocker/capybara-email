Easily test [ActionMailer](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/actionmailer) and [Mail](https://github.com/mikel/mail) messages in your Capybara integration tests

## Installation ##

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'capybara-email'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install capybara-email

## Usage ##

### RSpec ###

In your `spec_helper.rb` require `capybara/email/rspec`.

```ruby
require 'capybara/email/rspec'
```

Example:

```ruby
feature 'Emailer' do
  background do
    # will clear the message queue
    clear_emails
    visit email_trigger_path
    # Will find an email sent to test@example.com
    # and set `current_email`
    open_email('test@example.com')
  end

  scenario 'following a link' do
    current_email.click_link 'your profile'
    expect(page).to have_content 'Profile page'
  end

  scenario 'testing for content' do
    expect(current_email).to have_content 'Hello Joe!'
  end

  scenario 'testing for a custom header' do
    expect(current_email.headers).to include 'header-key'
  end

  scenario 'testing for a custom header value' do
    expect(current_email.header('header-key')).to eq 'header_value'
  end

  scenario 'view the email body in your browser' do
    # the `launchy` gem is required
    current_email.save_and_open
  end
end
```

### Cucumber ###
Require `capybara/email` in your `features/support/env.rb`

    require 'capybara/email'

Once you have required `capybara-email`, gaining access to usable methods
is easy as adding this module to your Cucumber `World`:

    World(Capybara::Email::DSL)

I recommend adding this to a support file such as `features/support/capybara_email.rb`

```ruby
require 'capybara/email'
World(Capybara::Email::DSL)
```

Example:

```ruby
Scenario: Email is sent to winning user
  Given "me@example.com" is playing a game
  When that user picks a winning piece
  Then "me@example.com" receives an email with "You've Won!" as the subject

Then /^"([^"]*)" receives an email with "([^"]*)" as the subject$/ do |email_address, subject|
  open_email(email_address)
  expect(current_email.subject).to eq subject
end
```

### Test::Unit ###

Require `capybara/email` at the top of `test/test_helper.rb`

```ruby
  require 'capybara/email'
```

Include `Capybara::Email::DSL` in your test class

```ruby
class ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  include Capybara::Email::DSL
end
```

Example:

```ruby
class EmailTriggerControllerTest < ActionController::IntegrationTest
  def setup
    # will clear the message queue
    clear_emails
    visit email_trigger_path

    # Will find an email sent to `test@example.com`
    # and set `current_email`
    open_email('test@example.com')
  end

  test 'following a link' do
    current_email.click_link 'your profile'
    expect(page).to have_content 'Profile page'
  end

  test 'testing for content' do
    expect(current_email).to have_content 'Hello Joe!'
  end

  test 'testing for a custom header' do
    expect(current_email.headers).to include 'header-key'
  end

  test 'testing for a custom header value' do
    expect(current_email.header('header-key')).to eq 'header_value'
  end

  test 'view the email body in your browser' do
    # the `launchy` gem is required
    current_email.save_and_open
  end
end
```

### CurrentEmail API ###

The `current_email` method will delegate all necessary method calls to
`Mail::Message`. So if you need to access the subject of an email:

```ruby
current_email.subject`
```

Check out API for the `mail` gem for details on what methods are
available.

## Sending Emails with JavaScript ##
Sending emails asynchronously will cause `#open_email` to not open the
correct email or not find any email at all depending on the state of the
email queue. We recommend forcing a sleep prior to trying to read any
email after an asynchronous event:

```ruby
click_link 'Send email'
sleep 0.1
open_email 'test@example.com'
```
